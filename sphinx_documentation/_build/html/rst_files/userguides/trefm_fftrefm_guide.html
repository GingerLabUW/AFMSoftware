<div class="section" id="flow-cell-tip-setup">
<h2>Flow Cell/Tip Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#flow-cell-tip-setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Typically these experiments are performed with the sample housed
within a flow cell. If the sample is simply in air, then it will
photo-oxidize during the process of imaging, and performance will
degrade with time.</p></li>
<li><p>To setup a flow cell, you will need several items:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image1.jpg"><img alt="image1" src="../../_images/image1.jpg" style="width: 3.24419in; height: 1.32524in;" /></a> <a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image2.jpg"><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/image2.jpg" style="width: 2.2093in; height: 1.6531in;" /></a></p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Specifically, you’ll need the flow cell housing (the
plastic beige thing), an o-ring that fits inside this casing, a
glass disk, a thin copper wire, some tape, a spanner wrench, and a
metal ring that fastens the glass disk in place. All of these items
can be found in the tiny gray cubbies on top of the workbench in
G44B. Don’t forget the small plastic red/clear screw that caps the
air line on the flow cell.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image3.jpg"><img alt="image3" src="../../_images/image3.jpg" style="width: 2.72083in; height: 2.93542in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Begin by cleaning the glass disk. We normally clean twice, first
with ethanol, followed by a glass-cleaner. After each wash, wipe the
disk off thoroughly with a kim wipe. If there is leftover epoxy from
a previous user, use a razor blade to scrape it off the disk,
holding the razor nearly parallel to the disk. Be careful and wear
gloves during this process. It is almost always a good idea to use a
fresh, clean, sharp razor.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the disk is clean, it can be placed onto the flow cell. First
make sure the small rubber o-ring is in place on the inside of the
cell, then cover it with the glass disk. Using a spanner wrench,
screw in the metal disk on top of the glass disk. Over-tightening
can cause the metal disk to pop out, so only apply a reasonable
amount of pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the sample needs to be grounded, we thread a copper wire
through one of the ports in the flow cell. See the picture to see
how this is done. Since the copper wire will eventually be attached
to the sample with silver paint, tape should be used to secure the
wire firmly in place on the glass disk. Ensure that the wire is
tightly secured by moving the copper wire around on the outside of
the flow cell; if little movement occurs on the inside of the flow
cell, then the wire is secured well.</p></li>
<li><p>Before going up to the glovebox, you’ll need a tip secured in a chip
holder, and the chip holder needs to be secured with what Asylum
calls a “paddle holder.” The tips we normally use for trEFM are
silicon probes coated with Cr/Pt, with a force constant of 30-40 N/m
and a resonant frequency of around 300 kHz.</p></li>
<li><p>Start by grabbing a tapping mode chip holder that has a flow cell skirt
attached, and set it on top of a chip holder platform:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image4.jpg"><img alt="image4" src="../../_images/image4.jpg" style="width: 1.77847in; height: 1.74375in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Using a small phillips screwdriver, loosen the screw on
top of the chip holder, but do not remove it completely. Using small
metal forceps (I like the curvy ones, I think they grip best) gently
grab a tip from the box and place it on top of the chip holder. If
you can, Place the back-end of the tip underneath the metal platform
that is tightened by the screw you just loosened. The tip should be
well-centered under the metal platform, and should extend out far
enough over the clear quartz area. Once the tip is in place, tighten
the screw (once again, not too tight). Test that the tip is secure
by applying a small amount of pressure to the <em>side</em> of the tip with
metal tweezers. If the tip doesn’t move, you are in business.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image5.jpg"><img alt="image5" src="../../_images/image5.jpg" style="width: 2.84861in; height: 2.13125in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>There are two types of paddle holders and your choice is completely
dependent on personal preference. Either type is essentially
composed of two paddles that you’ll want to place underneath the
metal washer that holds the chip holder to the flow cell skirt. See
picture for positioning. If using the black paddle holder, the
paddles can be held in place by using the small metal spanner with
two small screws. Thumb-tight is all that is necessary.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image6.jpg"><img alt="image6" src="../../_images/image6.jpg" style="width: 1.6in; height: 1.66in;" /></a>
<a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image7.jpg"><img alt="image7" src="../../_images/image7.jpg" style="width: 1.60248in; height: 1.66279in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>The last thing you’ll need is either some cotton-swabs or small
pipette tips, and a paper “target.” If you use cotton-swabs, cut
them into thirds. These will be used for mixing and placing epoxy.</p></li>
<li><p>Before moving on, it is best to take the tip and put it on the AFM
for alignment. Use your preferred method to find the tip with the
laser within the AFM. Details on how to align a tip can be found in
another SOP. When done, take it off the AFM and pack it up with
everything else.</p></li>
<li><p>When everything is ready, put it in a small container and take it up
to the glovebox where your samples are.</p></li>
<li><p>After everything is loaded in the glovebox, start by placing the
chip holder and flow cell onto some clean kim wipes in as much of an
open, clean space as possible. You’ll want a decent amount
of room to work in. Put the flow cell on top of the paper
target for positioning. You will also need to put gloves on to
prevent epoxy from getting on the glovebox gloves.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image8.jpg"><img alt="image8" src="../../_images/image8.jpg" style="width: 2.54792in; height: 1.90694in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Grab a small square of aluminum foil and place it on a
flat, sturdy surface. Generally there is a 24 well-container in the
glovebox that is labeled “Ginger Epoxy.” Using your cotton swab
thirds (the wood side, not the cotton!), grab a small amount of each
type of epoxy from separate wells (using a different cotton swab for
each material) and rub it off onto the aluminum foil. Again with a
cotton swab wood, mix the two chemicals together well in equal
proportions. When they are well mixed, grab a small amount with a
cotton swab and place two <em>small</em> dots diagonally apart from each other
on the glass disk.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image9.jpg"><img alt="image9" src="../../_images/image9.jpg" style="width: 2.57222in; height: 1.92986in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Quickly grab your sample with forceps and place it glass-side down
on top of the epoxy. It is important to make sure the portion of the
sample that has ITO is in line with the copper wire. If you miss the
positioning slightly, it’s okay, just use forceps to slide the
sample around slightly until it is in a good position.</p></li>
<li><p>After the epoxy dries (maybe about 5 minutes) use forceps
to make a small scratch in the sample, being sure to remove all of
the active layer and PEDOT:PSS, so that the wire can be in contact
with the ITO underneath. Use forceps to position the wire flat on top of
the scratched area. Paint it down with silver paint.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image10.jpg"><img alt="image10" src="../../_images/image10.jpg" style="width: 2.04583in; height: 1.86042in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>When the silver paint is dry, attach the chip holder to the flow
cell with the three thumb-screws. Align the straight edge of the
flow cell with the straight edge of the paddle holder. See picture
for positioning.</p></li>
<li><p>Now head back to the AFM!</p></li>

<div class="section" id="setting-up-the-afm">
<h2>Setting up the AFM<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-the-afm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image11.jpg"><img alt="image11" src="../../_images/image11.jpg" style="width: 2.39514in; height: 1.97153in;" /></a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>To set up the nitrogen/air flow, go to the back of the AFM.
There should be a three-way valve connecting white plastic hoses to
two flowmeters that are taped to a wooden stand. One of the
flowmeters controls nitrogen flow, and the other controls the house
air flow. Make sure the flowmeters are set to zero. Start by opening
the main valve on the nitrogen tank. Open the three-way valve to the
nitrogen tube, then adjust the flowmeter to read 0.1. Inside the AFM
enclosure is a small plastic tube that attaches to the flow cell. You
should be able to feel nitrogen coming out with a very light force;
it can be necessary to put the tube outlet up to your lips to feel
anything. This is as it should be. Leave the tube as it is for now.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image12.jpg"><img alt="image12" src="../../_images/image12.jpg" style="width: 2.45349in; height: 2.10286in;" /></a>
<a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image13.jpg"><img alt="image13" src="../../_images/image13.jpg" style="width: 2.38372in; height: 2.10985in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Put the AFM head upside down on the side platform inside
the enclosure. Attach the flow cell to the underside of the AFM. If
you’re using the black paddle holder, you’ll need to carefully
remove the metal spanner holding the paddles in place. It’s easiest
to completely unscrew one side, and then unscrew the other. Be
careful not to let the paddles slip out of place.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image14.jpg"><img alt="image14" src="../../_images/image14.jpg" style="width: 2.825in; height: 2.12014in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Put the AFM head back upright onto the microscope. Attach the
nitrogen/air flow tube to the flow cell, as well as the ground wire
to the copper electrode on the right of the microscope. At this
point you can start a timer for 30 minutes, since the sample is now
under a constant nitrogen flow. The sample will need to be
completely purged with nitrogen before starting any trEFM scans,
otherwise the device runs the risk of being photo-oxidized and
damaged.</p></li>
<li><p>Lower the front and back of the AFM head until the flow
cell fits snugly and flat in the microscope’s objective hole. Often
it will sort of “snap” or “click” into place. Once it’s in place,
you can <strong>now</strong> <strong>push the paddles in</strong>, essentially releasing the
chip holder. If you push the paddles in prior to getting the flow
cell into the objective hole, the tip is likely to crash into the
surface of the sample and break.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image15.jpg"><img alt="image15" src="../../_images/image15.jpg" style="width: 3.08125in; height: 2.31181in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Now it’s a good idea to tune the tip. Go to the “Tune”
tab of the Master Panel. For these tips, we generally tune to an
amplitude of 0.800 V (or 800 mV) with a target percent of -5.0%. Hit
auto-tune (queue jokes about modern pop music). Once the program
finishes, you should see it report the “Drive Amplitude” of the tip
in the same Tune panel. If the tip is good, its drive amplitude
should be anywhere from 20 to ~150. Anything above this is
questionable for trEFM and could be the result of a damaged tip, a
misaligned tip, or a misaligned photodiode.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image16.jpg"><img alt="image16" src="../../_images/image16.jpg" style="width: 3.41806in; height: 1.84861in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Go back to the Main panel of the Master Panel. Change the
Set Point to 650 mV. Now you can approach the surface of the sample.
Click engage on the “Sum and Deflection Meter”, and start lowering
the AFM head slowly and evenly between the front and back. After
hitting engage, the Z-Voltage should increase to its maximum value
of 150. This means that the piezo element which controls the height
of the tip is fully extended. It’s a good practice to place the
small level on top of the AFM head and make sure the tip is
balanced. When the tip gets close to the surface, the amplitude will
drop quickly and once it reaches the set point, the computer will
issue a short “beep” and the Z-Voltage will start dropping very
quickly. When you see the amplitude begin to drop, it’s a good idea
to start lowering the AFM head only with the front lever. Lower the
front lever until the Z-Voltage reads about 70, then click withdraw.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image17.jpg"><img alt="image17" src="../../_images/image17.jpg" style="width: 4.38333in; height: 1.94028in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Retune the tip, then hit engage again, and make sure the Z-Voltage
is at about 70.</p></li>
<li><p>At this point the sample needs to continue purging under nitrogen
for 30 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the sample has purged, it’s a good idea to start
with a simple topography scan. Under the main panel of the Master
Panel, there are a number of settings for the size, shape, angle,
position, and feedback settings for a topography image. I normally
start by doing a 5x5 μm scan with 256 points and lines. Before
starting the scan, click on “Path” and on the new window that pops
up click “Browse” and navigate to the folder you want to save data
in. When you’re ready to begin a scan, hit “Do Scan.” Usually I
immediately hit “Last Scan” right after beginning, otherwise the
program will just continually scan more and more images until you
hit stop. Clicking Last Scan makes it so that the program stops
after taking only one image.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image18.jpg"><img alt="image18" src="../../_images/image18.jpg" style="width: 2.63194in; height: 2.87153in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Once the scan starts, it is usually necessary to right-click the
HeightRetrace window and select “Fix Scale.” It may also be
necessary to manually change the scale by changing the “Data Scale”
and “Data Offset” values under the “Ht” tab of the Master Channel
Panel. Within this window, make sure the “Save Planefit” option is
set to None. This will force Igor to save the raw data, and not
pre-processed data.</p></li>
<li><p>You should see a topography image begin to form. To maximize the
resolution and quality of the image, you should optimize the
feedback settings. Generally the only ones that need changing are
the Set Point, Integral Gain, and Feedback Filter.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p>The set point essentially adjusts how close the tip is
to the surface. The set point should be low enough that it
responds quickly to the van der Waal’s forces of the surface as
it scans, but high enough that the tip doesn’t crash into the
surface or pick up debris and get damaged.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image19.jpg"><img alt="image19" src="../../_images/image19.jpg" style="width: 2.55694in; height: 1.54583in;" /></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Integral gain adjusts how quickly or slowly the feedback system
responds to changes in the surface topography. If the integral
gain is really low, then the tip will move up too slowly if it
encounters a high feature in the topography. Consequently, if the
integral gain is too high, the tip will respond too rapidly to
changes in the topography, causing “waves” in the topography
image that are a result of the feedback system overcorrecting,
and not the actual surface of the sample. Generally it is a good
idea to increase the integral gain until waves appear, and then
reduce it slightly until the waves go away.</p></li>
<li><p>The feedback filter will cut out any changes in the tip frequency
that are below a particular cutoff point. We typically use a
value of 1.0-3.0 kHz.</p></li>

<li><p>If everything looks good, a high-resolution image can be taken by
increasing the number of points and lines. The number of points to
lines needs to be proportional to the width and length of the image
size. Generally, an image with 512 points and lines is sufficient.</p></li>

<p>Setting up the Trigger Box</p>
<p>The trigger box is an external piece of electronics that does a couple
things. Overall, it triggers the LED to turn on at a particular point in
the phase of the oscillation of the tip, as well as the analog to
digital converter (the Gage card) to start collecting raw deflection
data for a particular window of time. Setup of the box can be a bit
confusing if it’s not already hooked up, but thankfully measures have
been taken to explicitly label each and every BNC cable. Should any
labels or BNC cables be missing, the following documents each connection
that must be made.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Connect a BNC between the left-most “X-DEFL INP” on the trigger box
and “Ch 2” on the Gage card.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect the deflection BNC coming out of the AFM enclosure to the
right-most “X-DEFL INP” on the Gage card.</p></li>
<li><p>The toggle on the trigger box should be set to “1 kHz.”</p></li>
<li><p>Connect a BNC between “TRIGGER INP” and BNC Output 1 on the ARC2.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect a BNC between “TTL TRIG 50-ohm” and “Trig” on the Gage card.</p></li>
<li><p>Plug the BNC coming out of the AFM enclosure from the LEDs to “LED
Out” on the trigger box.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect the LED Pwr BNC from the trigger box to a power supply (we
usually use the Tenma Power Supply). Note that the Protek Power
Supply is no longer used but remains on the computer table should it
become necessary.</p></li>

<li><p>The last thing to do is to make sure everything is turned on. Each
power supply needs to be powered on and the “Output” switches pushed
in. Make sure the voltage on the Tenma power supply isn’t so large
that it will burn out the LED (do this BEFORE pushing in the output
switch). The trigger box itself has two switches. To turn them on,
flip them both upwards.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep in mind that the trigger box contains two 9 V batteries. If the
trigger box later appears to not be working, begin troubleshooting by
taking the 9 V batteries out of the trigger box and checking to see
they are not dead (or below about 7 V) with a fluke meter. Replace if
necessary.</p></li>
